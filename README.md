# Attention
Last huge update coming in the next couple of weeks. After the update I won't add new features and will only maintain functionality of the program.
So if you have a suggestion that you think should be implemented, open up a new Issue or write me an E-Mail to bloodvioletssword@gmail.com.
The last update will include a CSS Stylesheet that will hopefully make them look like they were professionally edited. So keep an eye out  for upcomming updates :)

# Wuxiaworld to ePub Project
I am a big fan of many wuxiaworld novels and I needed to learn python. But I often get frustrated that i'm not able to save the chapters for offline reading. So I used this as a  motivation to create a python script that downloads chapters and saves them into an ePub format for easy reading on my iPhone.

## Getting Started

You will need to have python 3 installed.

### Step-by-step Tutorial

This python script was written and tested on MacOSX. To run first run the following line on terminal.

```
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

Navigate to the folder using terminal and run the following line

```
python main.py
```

### Work in progress
