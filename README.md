# Wuxiaworld to ePub Project
I am a big fan of many wuxiaworld novels and I wanted to learn python. But I often get frustrated that i'm not able to save the chapters for offline reading. So I used this as a  motivation to create a python script that downloads chapters and saves them into an ePub format for easy reading on my iPhone.

All content belongs to wuxiaworld and I claim no credit. This project was started for me to find a practical way to learn python and information retrieval.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have python 3 installed.

## Step-by-step Tutorial

This python script was written and tested on MacOSX. To run first run the following line on terminal.

```
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

Navigate to the folder using terminal and run the following line

```
python main.py
```
